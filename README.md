This project provides an API for accessing real-time market data using the MetaTrader 5 (MT5) Python API with a demo broker account. It leverages FastAPI to build a modern, high-performance backend and integrates WebSocket technology to stream live market updates efficiently. The goal is to deliver a lightweight, developer-friendly interface for financial data retrieval and experimentation.
